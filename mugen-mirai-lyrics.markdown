We can see blinking by stopping time

Strain eyes to the future, continuous impression above the sky

Vibrating light, shiny word is little bit, little bit

Speeding up Story Story (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Never ending dream (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Goodbye Starry night (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Look, I'll fly Are you ready?

Maybe so Maybe so Maybe

Ahh Maybe so Maybe so Mugen Mirai

Maybe so Maybe so Maybe

Look, I'll fly Are you ready?



First time of Wonder Land, each flower blooms

Get a magical sound that stroke ground

Get your body used to shiny light, a little bit, little bit

Speeding up Story Story (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Never ending dream (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

(Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Goodbye Starry night (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Starry Story (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Story (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Goodbye Starry night (Maybe so Maybe so Maybe)

Look, I'll fly Are you ready?

Maybe so Maybe so Maybe

Ahh Maybe so Maybe so Mugen Mirai

Maybe so Maybe so Maybe

Look, I'll fly Are you ready?
